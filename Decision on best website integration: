Decision on best website integration: 

Option 1:
*wix*

-Currently, Wix does not offer the option to accept payments on your site in Cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, BitCash).

Option 2:

Building website from scratch:

It will take a long time for young developers and need time for integration with other API's and funtions


option 3: 
However, most of website buiding website are mostly dedicated to a certain targert group such as designers making portfolios, small business exhibiting their goods

As it is:

1)can automate workflow

2)modular website builder

3)able to be integrated with many API's including Blockchain API called "Xooa"
