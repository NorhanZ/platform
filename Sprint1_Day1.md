**Day Objective:**

Understanding the platform cornerstones:

 1. Design:

 2. Software Development.

 3. Blockchain Technology. 

**Discussions:**
4 main discussions:
- Platform Objectives Priority: --> Read Me 

- List of To-Develop Functions: 

This is the Brainstorming for the Functions needed in the Platform --> Issue #1 (https://github.com/ANTS-COIN/platform/issues/1)

- Financing and Bidding system.

- Selection of the best websites for API's integration : --> Issue #2 (https://github.com/ANTS-COIN/platform/issues/2)

A Detailed discussion about approaches to implement the platform. 3 Main Approaches were highlighted:

1. Use Already ready made platforms like wix _(however, Stability and integration with Blockchain technology is questionable)_

2. Develop Platform from Scratch.

3. Integration of existing platforms _(Github, Wix, Zapier... etc)_ and From scratch development _(especially the Blockchain technology)_

**Decisions:**

- Platform Objective #2 is our start.

- For Short Term and Functional Prototype: Approach 3 will be taken.

- For Long Term: Develop from Scratch.

**Next Steps For Day 2:**

- Building the Backlog.

- Creating the Story Board and priorites.

- Blockchain Technology Brainstorming session
