2. Product Backlog --> Issue #4 (https://github.com/ANTS-COIN/platform/issues/4) 

- A detailed discussion about the user stories to include from the earners and enterprises was done. Along with their priorities, status, and maturity that will serve planning next sprints.

- An _**"experimentation"**_ section was added for a valuable brainstorming output about solving conflicts of accepting deliverables between clients and earners. **_A reviewing system_** will be added and mainly mentors will be reviewing as the experts of the platform. It'll be anonymously done with payment required.

- The definition of **Done** was set.

- What software will be used for future backlogs development.

3. Blockchain Technology Brainstorming:

- Discussions about different technologies and questions.

- 3 directions to go in:

1. Use existing Technology with its infrasturcture.

2. Launch Virtual Currencies. Create our own coin along with its infrastructure _(However, we need to take care of regulations)_

3. Go without cryptocurrencies.

- **Important Question:** Will we want to use the cryptocurrencies to be used only within the platform? or outside to the Egyptian market?

- Suggestion: Look at the backlog to see what's actually needed. 

**Decisions:**

- Repo file _**"Product Backlog V01"**_ for first version of Product Backlog.

- The _"Complexity"_ section in the backlog will be left for Developer team decision.

- Definition of **Done** is when Earners Submit Final Version and Clients accept submitted version with no more feedback.

- Ahmed Shamy (@AhmedOJ) will prepare a list of better software to use for developing backlogs.

**Next Steps For Day 3:**

1. Blockchain Technology:
- Scan and read more about different technologies.

- Think about Pros and Cons of each direction.

- Dicussion and Co-creation.

2. Updates on Backlog.

3. Design team to start Brainstorming on the platform UX/UI
